This project involves creating a detailed sales transaction report for a global store chain using Power BI. The report will provide insights into sales data, segmenting visuals by country, region, and market, analyzing shipping percentages based on ship mode, and presenting sales data by city, states, regions, and markets. The project aims to create an interactive sales report that allows stakeholders to explore and understand sales trends, patterns, and key performance indicators.
